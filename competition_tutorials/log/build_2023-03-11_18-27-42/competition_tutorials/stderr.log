CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findariac_msgs.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "ariac_msgs", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "ariac_msgs" with
  any of the following names:

    ariac_msgsConfig.cmake
    ariac_msgs-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "ariac_msgs" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "ariac_msgs_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "ariac_msgs" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
